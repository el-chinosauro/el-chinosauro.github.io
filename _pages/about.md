I am a **Postdoctoral Research Officer** at the [Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment](https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/) and a **Visiting Research Fellow** at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/geography-and-environment). I am also affiliated with the [Dragon Capital Chair Programme in Biodiversity Economics](https://www.dragonchair.org.uk/).

I am an applied economist working at the intersection of **environmental and development economics**. I combine large georeferenced data and satellite imagery with causal inference to study the heterogeneous impacts of public policy on socio-economic and ecological outcomes.

One strand of my research investigates the implications of market-based climate instruments in terms of **air quality** and **environmental justice**, with an emphasis on the distribution of co-benefits from carbon taxation. In parallel, I study the impact of layered economic shocks and policies on the **dynamics of deforestation and forest fires** in tropical countries, focussing on issues of **additionality and carbon leakage**. I have recently started working on the **economics of biodiversity**, on the relationship between **tropical ecosystem conservation and restoration** and **poverty alleviation**, and on the interplay between polluting industries, agriculture and **natural resources**.
