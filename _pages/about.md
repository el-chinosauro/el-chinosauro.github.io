I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at the [Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment](https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/) (LSE) and the [Land, Environment, Economics and Policy (LEEP) Institute](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/research/leep/about-us/) (University of Exeter), affiliated to the [Dragon Capital Chair Programme in Biodiversity Economics](https://www.dragonchair.org.uk/). 

My work combines **environmental and development economics**. I use applied econometrics, georeferenced data and satellite imagery to causally examine **complex interactions between the economy and the biosphere**. My research focusses on **forests, carbon and biodiversity additionality**, and on the interplay between **climate mitigation** and **economic development**. I am also interested in issues of **environmental justice and distribution**, and in the role of **polluting industries** in shaping environment-development trade-offs.
