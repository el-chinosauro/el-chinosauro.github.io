I am a **Postdoctoral Research Officer** at the [Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment](https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/) and a **Visiting Research Fellow** at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/geography-and-environment). I am also affiliated with the [Dragon Capital Chair Programme in Biodiversity Economics](https://www.dragonchair.org.uk/).

I am an applied economist working at the intersection of **environmental and development economics**. My research combines large georeferenced data and satellite imagery with econometric techniques to causally examine **complex interactions between the economy and the biosphere**.

One strand of my research investigates the role of **polluting industries** in shaping environment and development trade-offs, with a particular focus on issues of **environmental justice and distribution**. In parallel, I work on **forests, carbon and biodiversity additionality**, mostly within the context of the interplay between **climate mitigation** and **economic development**.
